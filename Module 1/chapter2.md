# Space Complexity

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input data. It’s important to analyze space complexity to ensure that the algorithm is not consuming excessive memory, which could lead to inefficiency or crashes in real-world applications.

## Key Points:
- **Auxiliary Space**: The extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm, excluding the space required to store the input.
- **Input Space**: The space used to store the input data.

## Space Complexity Classifications:

### O(1) Space Complexity (Constant Space):
The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.

**Example: Finding the maximum element in an array**
```python
def find_max(arr):
    max_val = arr[0]
    for num in arr:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val
```
Here, only a single variable is used to store the maximum value, so the space complexity is **O(1)**.

### O(n) Space Complexity (Linear Space):
The algorithm uses space proportional to the input size.

**Example: Creating a new array to store results**
```python
def reverse_array(arr):
    reversed_arr = []
    for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):
        reversed_arr.append(arr[i])
    return reversed_arr
```
In this case, the space used grows linearly with the input size, making the space complexity **O(n)**.

## Trade-offs Between Time and Space Complexity
Often, there is a trade-off between time complexity and space complexity. Optimizing one may result in an increase in the other. A good example of this is the use of **memoization** (caching the results of expensive function calls to avoid recomputation).

### Example 1: Space-Time Trade-Off in Recursion (Memoization)
**Fibonacci sequence using memoization**
```python
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) due to memoization.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to storing results in the memo.

### Example 2: Time Optimization with Extra Space (Hashing)
Checking for duplicates using a hash set.
```python
def has_duplicates(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

## Space Complexity in Different Algorithms

### 1. In-place Algorithms
In-place algorithms work by modifying the input data directly, without using extra memory for storing the result.

**Example: Insertion Sort**
```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

### 2. Algorithms Using Extra Space
Some algorithms require additional space for temporary data structures. A classic example is **Merge Sort**.

**Example: Merge Sort**
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    while left and right:
        if left[0] < right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(right.pop(0))
    result += left
    result += right
    return result
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (extra space for temporary arrays)

### 3. Dynamic Programming (DP)
Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them down into subproblems and storing their solutions.

**Example: 0/1 Knapsack Problem**
```python
def knapsack(weights, values, W):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (W + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, W + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], values[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][W]
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * W)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * W) due to the DP table.

## Practical Space Complexity Considerations
When optimizing for space, consider:
- Eliminating unnecessary temporary data structures.
- Avoiding recursion (or using iterative solutions).
- Being aware of space usage in data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees).

### Example: Space-Time Trade-off in Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS typically uses a queue to explore nodes level by level.
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return visited
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), as the queue stores up to V nodes.

## Summary of Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: Constant space, used in algorithms that don’t require extra memory.
- **O(n)**: Linear space, used in algorithms that store data proportional to input size.
- **Trade-offs**: Optimizing for time often increases space complexity, and optimizing for space can increase time complexity.
- **In-Place Algorithms**: Modify the input directly without extra space.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Can trade space for time but may consume more memory.
